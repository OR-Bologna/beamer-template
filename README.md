# Beamer template

This is the Beamer template made for the Operational Research group at the University of Bologna.

## Usage

Make sure to have all the `*.sty` files and the folder `figures` in the directory you are working. It's just enough to instruct Beamer to use the "orbo" template with

```latex
\usetheme{orbo}
```
